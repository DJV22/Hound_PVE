 3. Create your ZFS pools or Import them as needed

To create your ZFS pool do the following

Goto PVE - ZFS on the right column, select create zfs from top right and complete information

Name - use your desired name
I used the following
first add backups
second add media
compression on by default
ashift 12 by default
Raid level I chose RAIDZ (My config breakdown = 3 20TB disk 1 parity 2 actual drives equaling 40TB of storage. If 1 disk fails you can recover data)
Do not enable firewall on any containers because it will interfere with portfowarding and gateway we currently have
Adding datasets to match planned file structure configuration from the PVE shell console - for tank-backups use the following command to create a zfs dataset for ProxMox storage

zfs create backups/vz This is where "whole-machine" backups, LXC Container templates, and bootable ISO images will go.
Once created you can add it to ProxMox storage by following these steps
REMOVE Backups zfs if it exist prior to adding backups directory
ID backups, Directory /backups/vz
On Datacenter:Storage use the Add button and select Directory.
Give it an ID of backups and the directory is /backups/vz. The Shared: box should be off, as there are no additional nodes in this setup.
Select the Content: button and add VZDump backup file, Container template, and ISO image. This is where "whole-machine" backups, LXC Container templates, and bootable ISO images will go
We want to turn OFF those options from "local", this removes this data from the root zfs storage (id:local)
Select it and use "Edit" to deactivate those selections in Content:, and make sure "Snippets" is active.
If "Snippets" come into use, they will be small.
local-zfs pool should only have disk image and containers.

from the faster drive, and you can't save the options
for "media" use the following commands - This creates the datasets to be used once the fileserver container is created.
zfs create fileserver/home
zfs create fileserver/share
zfs create filerserver/media
Use the command zfs list to ensure all datasets were properly created and ready for use.
to import your previous ZFS pool you must use the following shell commands after ensuring the drives are connected and available

In this case I used the following commands from pve console
zpool import -f tank-fileserver
zpool import -f tank-backups
If the import fails you may have to use "zpool import -f (poolname) flag to force the import. This may need to be followed be the "zpool -e" flag to make it permanent.
Use the command zfs list to ensure all datasets were properly imported and ready for use.
Once imported you can add it to ProxMox storage by following these steps

On Datacenter:Storage use the Add button and select Directory.

Give it an ID of "tank-backups" and the directory is /tank-backups/vz. The Shared: box should be off, as there are no additional nodes in this setup.

Select the Content: button and add VZDump backup file, Container template, and ISO image. This is where "whole-machine" backups, LXC Container templates, and bootable ISO images will go

We want to turn OFF those options from "local", this removes this data from the root zfs storage (id:local)

Select it and use "Edit" to deactivate those selections in Content:, and make sure "Snippets" is active.

If "Snippets" come into use, they will be small.

local-zfs pool should only have disk image and containers.

local-zfs pool should only have disk image and containers.

from the tank-fileserver container shell use the following commands -

This creates the datasets to be used once the fileserver container is created.

zfs create fileserver/home

zfs create fileserver/share

zfs create fileserver/media

Use the command zfs list to ensure all datasets were properly created and ready for use.
